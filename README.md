Short-simple programmed sports game that follows the concept of beach-volleyball with 2 players on each team

Summary:
Thinking about creating a game that follows the concept of beach volleyball. There will be two players administered on each team that will be specifically labeled with a team name. The rules of volleyball will apply to this game: Up to three touches, grounded ball on the court wins the point, last team that touches it loses the point, and games will be first to 15. 

There will be differnt functions regarding the specificies and mechanics of the game. Core functions will include scorekeeping, team separation, emphasis on three touches to follow the concepts of volleyball. More specificity and customization can be included after the base is set and running.
